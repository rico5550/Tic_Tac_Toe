# Common Issues and Their Solutions

## Format Issues

### Problem

Incorrect data formatting can prevent the model from being fine-tuned.

### Solution

Ensure your data adheres to the format required by the specific model. For our current setup, we use the davinci-002 model, which mandates the prompt-completion format. For easy conversion, navigate to the `tools` folder. Within, you'll find the utility file `convert_format.py` that converts standard JSON prompt-response data into the `.jsonl` prompt-completion format.

## Absence of API Key

### Problem

Missing or invalid API key.

### Solution

1. **Sign Up for OpenAI**: If not done yet, register for an account with OpenAI.
2. **Access the OpenAI Dashboard**: Post registration, head over to the OpenAI platform or dashboard.
3. **Request API Access**: Historically, GPT-3's API access was restrictive. As of 2022, you might have to enlist in a waitlist or specifically request access. This procedure is dynamic, so always refer to OpenAI's latest updates or documentation.
4. **Retrieve Your API Key**: Once granted access, go to the API section on the dashboard. Here, you can view or generate your API key.
5. **Incorporate the API Key into Your Code**: Use this API key in your scripts or applications to interface with OpenAI's services.
6. **Adhere to Rate Limits and Costs**: Bear in mind that API usage isn't free. Always be updated on OpenAI's pricing nuances and rate limits to avoid unexpected charges or service restrictions.
