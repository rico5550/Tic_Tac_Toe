    "X" represents Player 1.
    "O" is the marker for Player 2.
    The playground has a 3x3 grid format.
    Filling an unoccupied space with their symbol is the objective of each move.
    Occupied spaces are off-limits for placing symbols.
    Victory is achieved by lining up three identical symbols either in a straight line or diagonally.
