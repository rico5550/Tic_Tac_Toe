Tic Tac Toe LLM Translator

Welcome to the Tic Tac Toe LLM (Language-to-Logic Model) Translator. This project aims to bridge the gap between natural language descriptions and logical game implementations by translating English sentences into functional pseudo-code.

ðŸŽ® About the Project:

Domain Focus: We're channeling our efforts towards the classic game of Tic Tac Toe, aiming to make its rule-based implementation more intuitive and accessible.
Core Functionality: This LLM accepts game rules for Tic Tac Toe in plain English and returns a structured pseudo-code, providing a foundational blueprint for building the game.
ðŸ“œ Features:

Natural Language Processing: Built on advanced NLP techniques, our LLM comprehends the intricacies of the English language, ensuring accurate translations.
Intuitive Output: The returned pseudo-code is structured, concise, and can serve as a stepping stone for developers looking to build or understand the game's mechanics.
Expandable Framework: While the current focus is on Tic Tac Toe, the underlying principles are designed with expandability in mind, potentially accommodating other rule-based games in the future.
